    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist. He was born on July 10, 1856, in the village of Smiljan, which was then part of the Austrian Empire (now Croatia).</p>

    <p>Tesla showed great intellectual abilities from a young age and had a remarkable memory. After completing his education in engineering and physics, he started his career working in various electrical engineering companies in Europe.</p>

    <p>In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and began working with Thomas Edison at the Edison Machine Works. However, due to differences in their approaches to electrical power, they soon parted ways, and Tesla embarked on his own path.</p>

    <p>One of Tesla's most significant contributions was the development of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical system. He championed AC over Thomas Edison's direct current (DC) system, demonstrating its superiority in long-distance transmission and its ability to power multiple devices simultaneously.</p>

    <p>Tesla's invention of the polyphase AC induction motor was another groundbreaking achievement. It revolutionized the industrial world by enabling the efficient generation and distribution of electricity, leading to the electrification of cities and the widespread adoption of electric motors in various industries.</p>

    <p>Throughout his career, Tesla held numerous patents for his inventions and made remarkable discoveries. He worked on wireless power transmission, laying the groundwork for modern radio communication. Tesla also experimented with X-rays, electric resonance, and developed the Tesla coil, a high-voltage transformer used in a wide range of applications, including wireless communication and electrical lighting.</p>

    <p>Despite his remarkable contributions to science and technology, Tesla faced financial difficulties and struggled to gain widespread recognition during his lifetime. He often prioritized his research and inventions over financial gain, which led to challenges in securing funding and commercializing his inventions.</p>

    <p>Later in his life, Tesla faced personal and health challenges, but he continued to work on new ideas until his death on January 7, 1943, in New York City. His legacy, however, endured long after his passing.</p>

    <p>Today, Nikola Tesla is celebrated as one of the greatest inventors and scientists in history. His visionary ideas and inventions laid the foundation for modern power systems, wireless communication, and many other technologies that shape our world today.</p>
